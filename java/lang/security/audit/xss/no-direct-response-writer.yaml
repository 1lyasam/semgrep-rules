    message: >-
      Directly writing to a `HttpServletResponse` object bypasses view and template environments,
      _including_ HTML escaping. In the worst case, this exposes your application to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) 
      vulnerabilities. Instead, consider a view technology such as JavaServer Faces (JSFs) that automatically escapes HTML views.

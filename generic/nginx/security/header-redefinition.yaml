  message: The 'add_header' directive is called in a 'location' block after headers
    have been set at the server block. Calling 'add_header' in the location block
    will actually overwrite the headers defined in the server block, no matter which
    headers are set. To fix this, explicitly set all headers or set all headers in
    the server block.

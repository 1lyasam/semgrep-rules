  message: The special variable IFS affects how splitting takes place when expanding
    unquoted variables. Don't set it globally. Prefer a dedicated utility such as
    'cut' or 'awk' if you need to split input data. If you must use 'read', set IFS
    locally using e.g. 'IFS="," read -a my_array'.

  message: The syntax `<%== ... %>` is an alias for `html_safe`. This means the content
    inside these tags will be rendered as raw HTML. This may expose your application
    to cross-site scripting. If you need raw HTML, prefer using the more explicit
    `html_safe` and be sure to correctly sanitize variables using a library such as
    DOMPurify.
